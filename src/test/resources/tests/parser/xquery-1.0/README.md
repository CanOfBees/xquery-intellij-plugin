# XQuery 1.0 Test Files

This is an extensive set of tests for an XQuery 1.0 parser that cover both
valid and invalid constructs. The text files are the expected AST generated
for the corresponding XQuery file by the parser in this project.

These tests only cover the different sequences of tokens, not the lexical
spaces those tokens belong to. The lexical space variations are handled by
the Lexer tests.
