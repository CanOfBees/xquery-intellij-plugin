 * An XQuery 1.0 `Import` node in the XQuery AST.
 *
 * Because the child nodes of an `Import` are only referenced
 * from the `Import` node in the grammar, the `Import`
 * nodes are stored as instances of the child nodes instead of as distinct
 * nodes themselves.
 *
 * In the case of an invalid `Import` declaration that has an
 * `import` keyword that does not form a `SchemaImport`
 * nor `ModuleImport`, an `Import` node is used directly.
 * This is because there is not enough information to know what type of import
 * declaration this is.
