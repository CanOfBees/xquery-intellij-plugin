/**
 * IntelliJ defines a DSL for creating UIs, but currently has several disadvantages:
 * 1.  It is not supported on IntelliJ 2019.1 or earlier;
 * 2.  It is classified as being in active development, with potential breaking changes between releases;
 * 3.  It is not necessarily comparable to the swing API in terms of available functionality and flexibility.
 *
 * As such, a swing compatible DSL is defined in this file.
