This inspection checks the version in an XQuery version declaration for
values supported by the selected XQuery processor.

Unsupported versions would raise `XQST0031` errors on the XQuery processor.

__Note:__ This inspection also checks that the XQuery version is the same
across MarkLogic transactions. Different versions would raise
`XDMP-XQUERYVERSIONSWITCH` errors on MarkLogic.
