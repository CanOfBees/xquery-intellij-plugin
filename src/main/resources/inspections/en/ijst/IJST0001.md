This inspection checks if the XQuery construct is implemented in the
selected XQuery processor version and XQuery dialect. This covers:

1.  Constructs in later specification versions, such as XQuery 3.1
    `map` and `array`.

1.  Constructs not implemented in the selected implementation version,
    such as MarkLogic's partial XQuery 3.0 support.

1.  Constructs from XQuery extensions such as the Full Text extension.

1.  Vendor-specific extensions, such as MarkLogic `binary` constructors,
    and BaseX `update` expressions.

These constructs would raise `XPST0003` errors on that XQuery processor.
