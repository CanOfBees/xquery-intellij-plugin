This inspection checks valid `PredefinedEntityRef` constructs. In
standard XQuery, only XML predefined entity references are supported.
MarkLogic supports HTML4 and HTML5 predefined entity references in
the `0.9-ml` and `1.0-ml` XQuery versions.

The HTML4 and HTML5 constructs raise `XPST0003` errors on standard
conforming XQuery processors.
