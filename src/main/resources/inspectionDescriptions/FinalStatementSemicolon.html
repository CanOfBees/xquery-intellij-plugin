    This inspection checks the semicolon usage of the last statement in a
    multi-statement query bodies in MarkLogic transactions, and Scripting
    Extension apply expressions. This case is ambiguous, so the parser
    cannot detect which one to use.
</p>
<p>
    MarkLogic does not allow semicolons at the end of a multi-statement
    (transaction), or single-statement query. Including a semicolon here
    would cause MarkLogic to raise an XPST0003 error.
</p>
<p>
    Scripting Extension 1.0 requires all statements in a multi-statement,
    and allows a single-statement to end in a semicolon. Not including a
    semicolon here would cause the XQuery processor to raise an XPST0003
    error.
