    This inspection checks if the XQuery construct is implemented in the
    selected XQuery processor version and XQuery dialect. This covers:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>constructs in later specification versions, such as XQuery 3.1
        <code>map</code> and <code>array</code>;</li>
    <li>constructs not implemented in the selected implementation version,
        such as MarkLogic's partial XQuery 3.0 support;</li>
    <li>constructs from XQuery extensions such as the Full Text extension;</li>
    <li>vendor-specific extensions, such as MarkLogic <code>binary</code>
        constructors, and BaseX <code>update</code> expressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>These constructs would raise XPST0003 errors on that XQuery processor.</p>
