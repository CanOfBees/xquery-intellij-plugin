# Predefined Entities

These resource files provide the data for the `PredefinedEntityRef` entity
validation. These files are in the same format as the HTML 5, and WHATWG
named character entities data files to make it easier to directly include
those files.

__NOTE:__ The order of the entities in `html4.json` match the ordering of
the entities in the [HTML 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html)
entities page.
