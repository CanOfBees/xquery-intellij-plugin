title: XQuery IntelliJ Plugin 1.2
category: release

Language Support:

1.  Support BaseX 8.4 `non-deterministic` function calls.
1.  Support mixing arrow and transform with expressions, allowed in BaseX.
1.  Improved performance by not creating PSI (AST) nodes for EBNF symbols that
    are just forwarding to a sub-expression.

Bug Fixes:

1.  `TransformWithExpr` containing an empty expression body should not report
    a parser error as it is allowed by the Update Facility 3.0 specification.
1.  Parse `UpdateExpr` correctly, according to how it is handled in BaseX.
1.  Don't crash when computing folding for a partial direct element node inside
    an outer direct element node.
